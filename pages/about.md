Welcome to {{ site.title }}! I’m Shelby Harbour, a former English teacher turned editor who swapped classrooms for a home office and whiteboards for a digital pen. Over a decade of teaching—six years in the U.S. and four in the cobblestone charm of Prague—I honed my craft helping students bring their ideas to life through writing. My students and I spent countless hours carefully choosing words, clarifying thoughts, and poring over every detail to make sure each sentence sparkled.

While in Prague, a chance opportunity to proofread for a local NGO opened my eyes to a whole new career path. Two courses with Knowadays later, and I was hooked on editing. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of working with clients on a diverse range of projects—from religious nonfiction and online articles to poetry collections and online course content.

There’s nothing I love more than helping clients make their words jump off the page (for all the right reasons, of course)!

When I’m not fine-tuning sentences, you’ll probably find me savoring a bowl of queso or binge-watching K-dramas—because even editors need their guilty pleasures!
