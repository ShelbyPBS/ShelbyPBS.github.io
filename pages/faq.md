### What is your process?
1. <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> with the details of your project: word count, genre, what type of editing you are looking for, English dialect, etc.

2. We will schedule a discovery call where I can get to know you, how the project came to be, and your hopes and dreams for the project. We will work on a style sheet specific to you. You will then send me a 1,000 word sample that I will edit for free, so you can get to know my style and see if I am the right editor for you.

3. If you want to move forward, I will send you a contract and an invoice with a completed price quote and a timeline for completion of the work.

4. You will sign the contract and pay a 10% deposit to reserve your spot in my schedule.*

5. Send me your project, and I'll get started!

6. When the work is finished, you have the option of a follow-up call to discuss my suggested edits face-to-face.

\*Payment plans are available. 

### What services do you offer?
I offer proofreading, line editing, and copyediting services. I can do developmental edits, but they are not what I feel I am best at. More details about my services are <a href="/proofedbyshelby/services">here</a>.

### What types of writing do you work with?
I am open to working on a variety of documents. In the past, I have worked on: poetry collections, marketing reports, academic journal articles, research papers, blog posts, curriculums for non-profits, math curriculums, religious nonfiction, and short stories.

As a former middle school teacher, I have extensive experience with middle-grade novels and curriculum creation.

### How much do you charge?
This varies greatly based on the type of project and its length. The Editorial Freelancers Association (EFA) has put together <a href="https://www.the-efa.org/rates/" target="_blank">a list of recommended rates</a> that I follow. Depending on what you need, my prices range from $.01 to $.03 per word. To find out about your project specifically, <a href="/proofedbyshelby/contact">contact me!</a>

### What is your turnaround time?
Again, this depends on the size of your project and what other projects I am working on at the time. If you want, you can fill out this form and I can let you know what I can do for your project!
