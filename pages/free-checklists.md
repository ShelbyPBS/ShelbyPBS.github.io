I remember feeling unsure of what mistakes I should be looking for in my students' writing. I realized making a list of the common mistakes they were known to make and the skills they needed to master by the end of the school year would help guide me as I looked over their writing samples. This not only made me less overwhelmed, but it helped speed up the process!

I used this same idea to create free checklists that can show you what to look for as you are proofreading your own content (business, academic, or creative).
