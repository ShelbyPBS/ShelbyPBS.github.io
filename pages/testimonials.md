> Shelby proofread and edited my responses to reader questions for a novel that is being prepared to be sent to publishers. Her feedback was so helpful in ensuring I was able to communicate my thoughts in as constructive a way as possible. She had wonderful suggestions and was so encouraging. Having her professional opinion on my responses really helped me feel confident in submitting them. I will definitely be a repeat customer and highly recommend choosing her for all of your proofreading and editing needs! <cite>Rebecca Logan</cite>

> I had the pleasure of working with Shelby on the English version of a qualitative research report Integration of Asylum Beneficiaries in the Czech Republic.

> We had Shelby review my daughter's college application essays.  My daughter writes well, but Shelby made some great suggestions that made the essays much better.  This eased my daughter's mind and gave her more confidence when submitting the applications.  Shelby was very easy to work with, quick with responses and the price was extremely fair. We were very pleased with her service. <cite>The Tighe Family</cite>
